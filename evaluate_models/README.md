## 1 Organization of the Directory 
 * `notebooks/`: It contains notebooks to evaluate supervised baselines and RL fine-tuned models.

## 2 Evaluating Supervised Baselines

 * To evaluate our supervised baselines on our sampled responses, open `notebooks/03_evaluate_supervised_baselines.ipynb` and run the cells.

## 3 Evaluating RL fine-tuned

 * To evaluate our RL fine-tuned (policy-1) on our sampled responses, open `notebooks/01_evaluate_policy-1.ipynb` and run the cells.
 * To evaluate our RL fine-tuned (policy-2) on our sampled responses, open `notebooks/02_evaluate_policy-2.ipynb` and run the cells.
